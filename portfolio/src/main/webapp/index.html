      <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Feng, and I am a sophomore at Cornell University, majoring in Computer Science. 
        I'm fascinated by the flexibility and creativeness of programming, and hope to explore many avenues of tech 
        while learning about the diverse impact computer science has on the world. 
        When I'm not typing away on my computer, you can catch me bopping to good music, watering the plants in my
         mini-garden, or capturing nature's beauty through photography.
    </p>
    <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
    <p>I've always been awestruck by the vast potential computer science has and its global impact. The 
        interdisciplinarity and versatility of the field allows for the perfect amount of breadth and depth
        into various topics seemingly unrelated to technology. As someone who wants to explore all of her 
        interests, I felt computer science would be a fitting path for me to take, with just the right amount 
        of individual creativity mixed with team collaboration and technical diversity.
    </p>

    <h2>A Couple of Things I've Worked On</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Guide to Justice</b> - an application that congregates useful resources relating to social justice and actions</li>
        <li><b>SmartCap</b> - a prototype of a solution to blind spots using RaspberryPi, Python, and OpenCV</li>
        <li><b>Critter World</b> - a simulation of creatures that can perform all necessary functions and automatically move across the screen</li>
    </ul>

    <p> I started my photography journey from the desire to preserve memories, 
        whether it be on my elementary school field trip or on my way to class.
        The camera acts as my alternate vision, where I see everyday happenings in 
        a different light and want to save that portrayal of my feelings in that moment.  
        Photography allows me to lose track of time and diverts my focus from the screen 
        to appreciating and capturing a moment in time.</p>
    
    <h2>A hidden talent</h2>
    <image src="/images/chopsticks.png" class="blog"/>
    <p>I have never lost at a game of 'chopsticks', the finger game.
        I welcome you to be the next challenger! Would you join me? </p>
